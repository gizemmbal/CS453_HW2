39819,"#39814 Fix ""Execute"" actions disabled when SQL editor is not focused",Refactor: Simplify SQLEditor Property Tester Logic,This reverts https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/39373.,"This change refactors the `SQLEditorPropertyTester` to improve its robustness and simplify the logic for determining editor properties. It removes direct dependencies on `TextViewer` and `StyledText` widgets, and broadens the receiver type to `SQLEditorBase`. This ensures actions like ""statement"" are enabled based on the query mode, rather than requiring the editor's text widget to be focused."
39818,"#39814 Fix ""Execute"" actions disabled when SQL editor is not focused",Refactor: Simplify SQLEditor Property Tester and Remove Focus Check,This reverts https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/39373.,"This PR refactors the `SQLEditorPropertyTester` by removing direct dependencies on `TextViewer` and `StyledText` classes. It simplifies the property testing logic, notably by removing the `textWidget.isFocusControl()` check for the ""statement"" property, making the property evaluation independent of UI focus. The change also updates the receiver type check to `SQLEditorBase` for broader compatibility."
39822,Dbeaver/pro#6949 fix bq ua,BigQuery: Remove Custom User-Agent Property,HF,"This PR removes the explicit setting of the 'UserAgentEntry' connection property for BigQuery data sources. The previous implementation constructed a custom User-Agent string using DBeaver's product name and version, which is no longer necessary."
39508,dbeaver/pro#6949 Fix bigquery user-agent header,Remove Custom BigQuery User-Agent Property,,"This change removes the explicit setting of a custom `UserAgentEntry` property for BigQuery connections. The previous implementation injected a DBeaver-specific User-Agent string, which is now no longer added to the connection properties."
39805,dbeaver/pro#5798 Add yellowbrick sso,Yellowbrick: Migrate to Native JDBC Driver and Enhance PGobject Handling,,"This PR updates the Yellowbrick database driver configuration to utilize the native `io.yellowbrick.jdbc.YellowbrickDriver` instead of the generic PostgreSQL driver. It also introduces specific recognition for Yellowbrick's shaded `PGobject` class, ensuring proper handling of Yellowbrick-specific data types. These changes improve compatibility and leverage the official Yellowbrick JDBC implementation."

It also introduces specific handling for Yellowbrick's shaded `PGobject` class to ensure accurate data type recognition."
39804,Dbeaver/pro#7599 fix athena driver,Athena: Rename Simba JDBC Driver to Amazon JDBC Driver,,This PR renames the Athena JDBC driver ID from `aws_athena_jdbc_simba` to `aws_athena_jdbc_amazon` in the plugin configuration. It also adds a replacement rule to ensure the new Amazon-specific driver effectively replaces any prior usage of the Simba-named driver.
39794,dbeaver/pro#7599 Fix driver saving config,Athena: Rename JDBC Driver ID for Consistency,,This change renames the internal ID of the Athena JDBC driver from `aws_athena_jdbc_simba` to `aws_athena_jdbc_amazon`. A new compatibility rule ensures that connections previously configured with the old driver ID are seamlessly updated to use the new one.
