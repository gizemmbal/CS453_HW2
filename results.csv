39877,dbeaver/pro#7698 Fix reasoning models for OpenAI,OpenAI: Filter Reasoning Messages from Completion Output,,"This change introduces a new `TYPE_FUNCTION_REASONING` constant and filters out messages of this type from OpenAI API completion responses. This ensures that internal reasoning steps from advanced OpenAI models, such as gpt-5, are not included in the final user-facing output."
39833,dbeaver/pro#7352 remove cli dependency from model bundles,Refactor: Extract CLI Module to Dedicated Plugin,closes dbeaver/pro#7352,"This pull request refactors CLI-related classes and packages, moving them from the `org.jkiss.dbeaver.model` plugin to a new, dedicated `org.jkiss.dbeaver.model.cli` plugin. This improves modularity and separates the core model from CLI-specific concerns. Consequently, the `getInstanceServer()` method has been removed from the `DBPApplication` interface, further decoupling the CLI server component."
39676,Dbeaver/pro#7442 http long polling fallback for ws event,WebSocket: Add Session Header and Public Ping Event Constructor,,"This PR introduces a new `WS_SESSION_HEADER` constant, ""X-LP-Session,"" for WebSocket communication, likely intended for session identification. Additionally, the constructor for `WSSessionPingClientEvent` has been made public, allowing for external creation and management of client session ping events. These changes enhance the flexibility and control over WebSocket session handling."
39703,dbeaver/pro#7517 Fix QM events sequence,Refactor AbstractExecutionContext Generics and Optimize Oracle Schema Lookup,,"This PR refactors `AbstractExecutionContext` to use two generic parameters, `DATASOURCE` and `OWNER`, streamlining the management of the owner instance and removing redundant fields and `getOwnerInstance()` methods in subclasses like `JDBCExecutionContext` and `StreamExecutionContext`. This change centralizes owner instance handling within the abstract base class. Additionally, `OracleExecutionContext` is updated to utilize a `LocalCacheProgressMonitor` when retrieving the default schema, potentially improving performance."
39821,dbeaver/pro#7644 fix athena settings,Athena: Add backward compatibility for old connection properties,Closes https://github.com/dbeaver/pro/issues/7644,"This PR enhances Amazon Athena connection handling by introducing backward compatibility for property names. It now checks for older property names like ""AwsRegion"" and ""S3OutputLocation"" as fallbacks for the region and S3 output location if the newer ""Region"" and ""OutputLocation"" properties are not present. This ensures that existing Athena connections configured with previous property names continue to function without issues."
39854,dbeaver/pro#7679 Fix NPE for remote systems,Prevent NullPointerException in Stream Producer File Selection,,"This PR addresses a potential NullPointerException in the stream producer settings when initializing the file selection dialog. It adds a null check for the input file, ensuring `DBFUtils.convertPathToString` is only called with a non-null path, which is now explicitly marked as `@NotNull`."
39671,dbeaver/pro# Core.net deps refactoring,Implement Global Proxy Configuration and Optimize Bundle Manifests,,"This pull request introduces support for retrieving global proxy settings by integrating with Eclipse's `IProxyService` in `UIServiceConnectionsImpl`. This enables DBeaver to leverage system-wide proxy configurations. Additionally, several `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` files have been optimized by removing redundant direct `Require-Bundle` entries, improving module dependency management."
39049,#38952 Implements MySQLSourceObject interface in MySQLTableColumn,Implement DDL Generation for MySQLTableColumn,Fixes https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues/38952,"The `MySQLTableColumn` class now implements the `DBPScriptObject` interface. This change adds the `getObjectDefinitionText` method, enabling DDL generation for individual MySQL table columns by delegating to `DBStructUtils.generateObjectDDL`."
39758,dbeaver/pro#7456 move sun jna to CE,PostgreSQL: Upgrade Waffle-JNA Library and JNA Dependencies,Closes dbeaver/pro#7456,"This PR updates the `waffle-jna` library for the PostgreSQL extension to version 3.5.1 and adds direct dependencies on `com.sun.jna` and `com.sun.jna.platform`. The `providesDriverClasses` method is also adjusted to correctly accommodate these new dependencies, particularly for GSSAPI/SSPI authentication scenarios."
39823,dbeaver/pro#7571: update connection icons,Refactor Athena and Redshift SVG Icons,"hotfix
closes dbeaver/pro#7571 icons updated ","This pull request refactors the SVG icon files for Athena and Redshift. The changes involve simplifying the SVG structure by removing clip-paths, consolidating multiple path elements, and adjusting color definitions for a cleaner and more optimized icon representation. The large Athena icon also gains explicit width and height attributes."
